Introduction: Habbi is an iOS and React app that helps promote healthy habits and allows users to track core values that they want to improve on everyday.

The user sets a wakeup time and a sleep time. At wakeup time a notification pops up to see and complete a series of things

1. The app shows a motivational quote
2. Dream journal
3. Core value that they want to practice (they get to input this or select something from a preset)
4. Todo: Important tasks they want to complete that day. Important tasks are always put first.
    a. Some type of motivation once they complete a task

During the day (optional):
1. User is able to add a journal entry
2. User is able to add/finish tasks

At night (notification 2 hours prior to sleep time) 
1. Nightly motivation
2. Accomplishments and completed tasks
3. Things they could have done better
4. Night journal (Mood Tracker)
